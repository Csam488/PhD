Title: cn.mops - Mixture of Poissons for CNV detection in NGS data
Description: cn.mops (Copy Number estimation by a Mixture Of PoissonS)
    is a data processing pipeline for copy number variations and
    aberrations (CNVs and CNAs) from next generation sequencing
    (NGS) data. The package supplies functions to convert BAM files
    into read count matrices or genomic ranges objects, which are
    the input objects for cn.mops. cn.mops models the depths of
    coverage across samples at each genomic position. Therefore, it
    does not suffer from read count biases along chromosomes. Using
    a Bayesian approach, cn.mops decomposes read variations across
    samples into integer copy numbers and noise by its mixture
    components and Poisson distributions, respectively. cn.mops
    guarantees a low FDR because wrong detections are indicated by
    high noise and filtered out. cn.mops is very fast and written
    in C++.
